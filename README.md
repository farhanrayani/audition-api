# 🎯 Spring Boot Audition Application

This project represents a fully implemented and production-grade audition application using **Spring Boot**. All original `TODO` statements have been completed, with best practices applied for code quality, testing, observability, and security.

---

## ✅ Completed TODOs

- **AuditionLogger**  
  Implemented logging methods for creating structured messages from `ProblemDetail` and HTTP status codes.

- **ResponseHeaderInjector**  
  Injected OpenTelemetry trace and span IDs into HTTP response headers.

- **WebServiceConfiguration**  
  Configured `ObjectMapper` for consistent JSON behavior. Added `RestTemplate` interceptor for request/response logging.

- **AuditionIntegrationClient**  
  Implemented all REST API calls to [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) with robust error handling.

- **AuditionController**  
  Added input validation, query parameter filtering, and new endpoints for retrieving post comments.

- **ExceptionControllerAdvice**  
  Centralized exception handling for `SystemException` and generic errors.

- **application.yml**  
  Secured actuator endpoints to expose only `health` and `info`.

- **build.gradle**  
  Enabled **Checkstyle**, **PMD**, and cleaned up dependencies with documentation.

---

## 🆕 New Components

- **AuditionComment**  
  Model class for comments.

- **Updated AuditionPost**  
  Includes a new `comments` field for embedded comment data.

- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**  
  Full test coverage for all service layers and controllers.

- **Code Quality Tools**  
  Configuration for Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs, and JaCoCo.

- **Integration Tests**  
  End-to-end testing to verify application behavior.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔗 REST API Endpoints

- `GET /posts`  
  Optional filters: `userId`, `title`.
